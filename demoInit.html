        <h2>Initialization - Commentary</h2>
        <p>Prior to preparing the AGC for launch, a few tests are run to verify the hardware is 
		operating correctly. The first test ensures that all the alert lights and digit segments 
		on the DSKY are operational. Verb 35 (Test Lights) initiates this check. The lights and 
		digits are all illuminated, and the lights and digits that have a flash feature flash. 
		After 5 seconds, the alerts are all turned off, but the digits remain lit. These are 
		extinguished using Verb 36 (Fresh Start).</p>
        <p>Next, self check routines are initiated by using Verb 21 (Load) to load Noun 27 (Self 
		Test options) with a value of 4 (4 specifies that erasable memory will be tested). This test
		will continue in the background until explicitly stopped by loading Noun 27 with a value
        of 0. Should an error be detected by this routine the PROG alert will be illuminated.</p>
        <p>Finally, to verify that fixed memory is valid, Verb 91 is used to display checksum
		values for each of the 36 banks of fixed memory. The last word of each bank of fixed memory
		contains a value that, when added to the sum of all the other words in the bank results in
		the bank number &mdash; or the complement of the bank number. The display for each bank 
		consists of (R1) the calculated bank sum, (R2) the bank number, and (R3) the check word. 
		After each bank is displayed, the next can be displayed by pressing PRO. The display is 
		terminated with V34 (Terminate function).</p>
