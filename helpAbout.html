        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Many components of the Apollo spacecraft were connected to, and controlled by, 
        the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC): the gyroscope-based stable "platform" called the 
        Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the accelerometers, the sextant 
        and telescope, the radar systems, and the orientation and propulsion systems. Nevertheless, 
        the most visible part of the Apollo computer was the Display and Keyboard (DSKY), 
        since that was how the astronauts interacted with it. iDSKY affords you the opportunity
        to experience the unique Verb/Noun interface that was invented to allow the Apollo
        crews to efficiently and succinctly "talk" to the Apollo on-board computers.</p>

         style="margin:0; padding:0;"></div>
        <p>Only a small subset of the functionality of the AGC is reproduced by iDSKY: its goal 
        is to give a feel for the <i>user interface</i> of the historical Apollo Guidance Computer. 
        While the basic operations (in particular the regular verbs) are faithfully simulated, most
        of the "real" functionality of the AGC &mdash; navigation and orientation control &mdash; is
        not available.</p>
