        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>The user interface of the Apollo Guidance Computer was the "Display and Keyboard," which was
        abbreviated to DSKY, and pronounced "dis-key". The Command Module had two DSKYs - one on the
        Main Display Console, and one at the navigation station. The Lunar Module had a single DSKY.</p>
        <h2>Display</h2>
        <p>The display consists of two major parts: the alert annunciators on the left, and
        the numeric display on the right. The alert annunicators are used to highlight various conditions:</p>

        <p>The numeric part of the display consists of three 2-digit displays that indicate the currently
        active Program, Verb and Noun; and three signed 5-digit registers. If a sign a present, this indicates
        that decimal data is being displayed; the absence of a sign indicates that data is displayed in
        octal.</p>
