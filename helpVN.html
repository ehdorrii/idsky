        <h2>Verbs and Nouns</h2>
        <p>The basic interaction consisted of specifying a 2-digit Verb code (to request an action),
           and a 2-digit Noun code (to indicate the object of the action). As an example, Verb 06 is
           "display", and Noun 44 is "orbital parameters." So to display the orbital parameters you would
           press the following sequence of keys: VERB, 0, 6, NOUN, 4, 4, ENTR. This sequence is indicated
           with the shorthand notation "V06N44E."</p>
        <p>Not all Verbs were for use of the crew: some verbs were used by the computer to request a
           crewmember to take an action. As an example, Verb 50 means "Please Perform", and would be used
           in combination with a Noun code 25 (checklist) and a checklist item number to request a 
           crewmember to perform a certain checklist task.</p>
        <p>Nouns represent various items of information. Each noun consists of 1, 2 or 3 components. For
           example, the orientation of the spacecraft is represented by its pitch, roll and yaw.</p>
        <p>A summary of the defined Verbs and Nouns is available in iDSKY by tapping the "List" button 
           at the top right of the display. This reference summary includes other lists that were
           included in the on-board documentation available to the crew: program numbers, alarm codes, 
           checklist codes, and navigation stars.</p>
        <h2>Basic Verbs</h2>
        <p>The verbs in the range 1-25 were used for basic display and entry operations. All the 0x
           verbs were requests to display data; all the 1x verbs were requests to monitor data - the display
           would be continuously updated at 1-second intervals until the display was cancelled by the
           user; and the verbs from 21 to 25 were used to load data.</p>
        <h2>Understanding Nouns</h2>
        <p>The AGC concept of <i>nouns</i> is analogous to the concept of<i>objects</i> in
           modern programming languages. Essentially, a noun represents an entity that may
           be defined by one or more attributes. As an example, the orientation of the
           spacecraft may be defined by its angular position in 3 axes relative to a
           reference platform. The orientation is a single concept, but it is respresented
           by three attributes. Each attribute is referred to as a <i>component</i>.</p>
        <p>Nouns consist of 1, 2 or 3 components. Each component is represented by a value
           in erasable memory. Memory in the AGC is organized as 15-bit words. Signed values
           are represented in one's-complement form. Unsigned values can range from 0 to 32767,
           and signed values can range from -16383 to +16383. The values in a pair of words
           can be combined to represent a signed number with a 28-bit mantissa; such values
           are "double precision" (DP) values.</p>
        <p>The AGC does not support "floating point" values. Instead, components are pre-scaled
           by an appropriate factor to achieve maximum precision for the range of values
           the component is intended to represent. Also, since the DSKY display does not
           contain decimal point indicators, values in the register displays have an <i>implied</i>
           decimal point. As an example, Noun 44 (Orbital Parameters) displays the Apoapsis and 
           Periapsis of the spacecraft orbit in 1/10ths of nautical miles; so a display of
           +00987 would be interpreted as 98.7 nmi. In the Noun table the implied decimal
           point is shown in the <i>Scaling</i> column. The <i>Scaling</i> column also lists the
           units that are represented by the displayed value.</p>
        <h2>AGC Architecture Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The size of a word in the AGC is fifteen bits.</li>
            <li>The developers used octal notation to represent binary data, so 
                each word can be represented in 5 octal digits.</li>
            <li>Data is stored in 1's complement form.</li>
            <li>"Erasable" memory (think RAM) consists of 8 &times; 256-word pages
                for a total of 2048 words. Erasable memory is implemented
                with "core" technology.</li>
            <li>"Fixed" memory (think ROM) consists of 36 &times; 1024-word pages
                for a total of 36,864 words. Fixed memory is implemented
                using "rope core" technology.</li>
        </ul>
