        <h2>Clock Display - Commentary</h2>
        <p>Like most computers, the AGC had a real-time clock. This clock was started at
           lift-off, and had a range of about 745 hours, 39 minutes (roughly 31 days). All 
           events during the flight were scheduled using this Mission Elapsed Time (MET). 
           Noun 36, "Time of AGC Clock," is the AGC's internal value for MET. It is 
           displayed in three parts: register 1 shows the hours (+00hhh), register 2 shows 
           the minutes (+000mm), and register 3 shows seconds and milliseconds (+0ssmm).</p> 
        <p>Verb 06 (display) provides a static display of the current value(s) of a specified Noun. 
           Pressing V06N36E displays the current value of Noun 36 (MET). Once a Verb and Noun have 
           been entered, pressing just ENTR re-executes the displayed Verb, and you will see the 
           new current value(s) of the specified Noun.</p>
        <p>Verb 16 (monitor) provides a display of the selected noun which is updated at 1-second 
           intervals. While a monitor Verb is active, pressing VERB, NOUN or CLR will stop
           the display from updating, and light the KEY REL annunciator. KEY REL is an 
           indication that the computer has data to display, but it cannot because the user
           is currently using the DSKY for another purpose. Pressing the KEY REL key relinquishes 
           control of the DSKY to the computer, and the display resumes.</p>
        <p>Verbs in the range 21-25 are used to change the value(s) of a noun. If you key in 
           a Verb without changing the current Noun, the new Verb acts on the currently selected 
           Noun. When a Load verb is entered, the Verb and Noun values blink to indicate that 
           the computer is expecting the user to enter a value. Verb 21 indicates that component 
           1 of the Noun is to be entered, Verb 22 indicates component 2, and Verb 23 indicates 
           component 3. Once all three components have been entered, the Verb and Noun stop blinking.</p>
        <p>KEY REL has been flashing while you were entering the new values for Noun 36, and
           once you have entered the last component, you must press KEY REL to allow the monitor
           display to continue. When you do this, you will see that the clock was updated to
           the value you entered when you pressed ENTR on the last component.</p>
