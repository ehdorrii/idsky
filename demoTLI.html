        <h2>TLI - Commentary</h2>
        <p>Trans-lunar injection (TLI) is performed by the third stage of the Saturn V, the
          S-IVB, and so is controlled by the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC). So like
          the launch phase, this event is only monitored by the AGC.</p>
        <p>The LVDC schedules
          events based on nine Time Bases (TBs). The first is TB0, which occurs 
          approximately 17 minutes prior to launch. TB6 is used as the time reference for TLI,
          and occurs 9 minutes and 38 seconds prior to S-IVB ignition. During the time leading
          up to ignition, various events are scheduled - cessation of tank venting, helium tank
          heating, ullage motor ignition, turbine spin-up, and so on.</p>
        <p>The burn parameters for TLI are uploaded directly to the LVDC from
          mission control, but the TLI Initiate/Cutoff program (P15) affords the crew the
          opportunity to manually update the initiation time of TB6, as well as the desired
          target velocity.</p>
        <p>Verb 37 (Change Program) is used to request P15 (TLI Initiate/Cutoff). When P15
          is started, it shows the currently set TB6 initiation time (Noun 33). This can be 
          changed by pressing V25E, and then entering the new time; or the displayed time can 
          be accepted by pressing PRO (Proceed).</p>
        <p>Next, the desired target inertial velocity (Noun 14) is displayed. Again, it can
          be changed by pressing V21E, and loading the new value; or accepted by pressing PRO.</p>
        <p>Once these parameters are set, P15 indicates the progression of the S-IVB engine
          startup sequence by various lights. When the start sequence begins, the UPLINK ACTY
          annuciator illuminates for 5 seconds. 105 seconds prior to ignition, the DSKY
          display is blanked for 5 seconds. In the time leading up to ignition, the 
          time-to-ignition is displayed in R1. Ten seconds after ignition occurs, R1 is changed
          to show time-to-cutoff.</p>
        <p>During the burn, R2 displays the remaining velocity to be gained (in feet
          per second), and R3 displays the current inertial velocity (also in fps). The display
          is updated at 1-second intervals, so you can watch R2 (as well as R1) count down 
          to zero, and R3 increment until the desired velocity is achieved.</p>
        <p>Once engine cutoff occurs, the display remains static. At this point a new program
          is selected.</p>
