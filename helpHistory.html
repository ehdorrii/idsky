        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>The Apollo flights to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s were made possible 
        only by stretching the limits of computer technology of the day. Early in the project, 
        guidance and navigation was recognized as perhaps the most crucial element in achieving 
        Apollo's goal. On 9 August 1961 the MIT Instrumentation Lab received the first major 
        contract awarded under the Apollo program, to develop the guidance and navigation 
        subsystem of the Apollo spacecraft. One of the first computer systems to utilize the
        new technology of integrated circuits, the project consumed 60% of the entire 
        industrial output of ICs in the U.S. in 1963.</p>
        <p>AC Spark Plug (later renamed Delco Electronics) of Oak Creek, WI, was the prime 
        contractor for the CM and LM  Guidance Systems. The hardware and software of the 
        AGC was developed by the MIT Instrumentation Lab in Cambridge, MA. Production manufacture 
        of the AGC was performed by Raytheon Corporation in Waltham, MA. The IMU and the 
        DSKY were manufactured by Delco Electronics in Oak Creek, WI; and Kollsman Instruments 
        Company of Elmhurst, NY manufactured the optical subsystem. Integration was accomplished 
        by Delco.</p>
        <p>Over the course of development, the AGC evolved considerably. The initial version was
        identified as Block I, and the flight version was Block II. All crewed Apollo spacecraft
        used the Block II AGC and DSKY. 57 Block II AGCs, and 138 Block II DSKYs were manufactured.</p>
