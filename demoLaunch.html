        <h2>Launch - Commentary</h2>
        <p>To prepare the AGC for launch, it must first be initialized. This is done by selecting 
		the <b>Prelaunch Initialization</b> program, P01. Programs are selected with verb 37, 
		<b>Change Program</b>. A flashing display is always an indication that the computer is 
		expecting some kind of input. A flashing Verb 37 means that the AGC is expecting a program 
		number.  Verb 37 does not act on a noun, but when the program number is keyed in it appears 
		in the Noun area of the display. After you press ENTR, the selected program appears in the 
		PROG display.</p>
        <p>Once Program 01 is started you won't see much happening other than having the <b>NO 
		ATT</b> alert illuminate for a few seconds. Prelaunch Initialization orients the IMU to its 
		coarse alignment position and resets the accelerometers. Once the hardware reports back to 
		the AGC indicating that it has properly reset, the <b>Prelaunch Gyrocompassing</b> program, 
		P02, is automatically started.</p> 
		<p>Prelaunch Gyrocompassing uses some basic physics to align the IMU. Using the effect of
        gravity to determine the local vertical, and the effect of precession caused by the rotation
        of the Earth at the latitude of the launch pad, it takes 640 seconds to establish a fixed
        orientation in space. Once a stable platform has been established, the AGC is ready for launch.
        None of this is visible inside the spacecraft, so iDSKY dispenses with the 640 second
        interval.</p>
        <p>At the instant of lift-off, umbilical cables are pulled from the first stage, which causes
        a signal to be sent to the AGC. In the event this signal isn't received, there is a backup 
        indication &ndash; Verb 75.</p>
        <p>About 3 minutes before the scheduled launch, the commander keys in Verb 75, <i>but does not 
		press ENTR</i>. When the lift-off signal is received (or the CDR presses ENTR on the latent 
		V75) the <b>Earth Orbit Insertion monitor</b> program (P11) is started. In this simulation 
		there is never going to be any indication of lift-off, so you need to use the manual back-up 
        indication by keying V75E. Notice that (1) the program indicator now shows <b>11</b>; and the 
		VERB and NOUN indicators show 06 (display decimal) 62 (flight parameters). These parameters 
		are updated every 2 seconds until S-IVB cutoff occurs. The numbers that are displayed show (1) 
		the inertial velocity (in feet per second); (2) the rate of change in altitude (also in fps); 
		and (3) altitude above the launch pad (in tenths of nautical miles).</p>
        <p>The actual numbers displayed during this simulated launch are based on one of the
        extended capability J-class missions, for which the booster payload capacity was increased in 
		part by lofting the spacecraft into a lower orbit than previous missions - roughly 93 nautical
        miles, as opposed to say, Apollo 12's 102 nmi orbit. Observe that the final altitude is reached
        at around 6.5 minutes after launch, well before S-II shutdown. The remaining four-plus minutes
        of boost are spent achieving orbital velocity - approximately 25,600 fps.</p>
        <p>Once orbital velocity has been achieved and S-IVB cutoff occurs, the last display is left 
		intact so that the crew can record these numbers. Then KEY REL is pressed to show the parameters 
        of the achieved orbit. These parameters are (1) apogee (nmi with one decimal); (2) perigee
        (nmi with one decimal); and (3) time of free fall (in minutes and seconds). That last parameter
        (TFF) is how long before earth impact occurs; in a stable orbit that number will be
        displayed as 59 59.</p>
        <p>Finally, the monitor of orbital parameters is terminated by pressing PRO, and the
        idle program (P00) is selected.</p>
